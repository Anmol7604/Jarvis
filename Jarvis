Certainly! You can adjust the voice characteristics using pyttsx3. Here's how you can modify the code to give Jarvis a more suitable voice:

```python
import openai
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Set Jarvis's voice properties
voice = engine.getProperty('voices')[1]  # Adjust the index for the desired voice
engine.setProperty('voice', voice.id)
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Adjust the speaking rate (words per minute)
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)  # Adjust the volume (0.0 to 1.0)

# Function to speak
def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Function to recognize speech
def listen():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
            print("You said:", text)
            return text
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            print("Sorry, I couldn't understand that.")
            return ""
        except sr.RequestError as e:
            print(f"Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {e}")
            return ""

# Function to interact with ChatGPT
def chat_with_gpt(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[
